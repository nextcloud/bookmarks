Nextcloud Bookmarks API
=======================

The Nextcloud Bookmarks app provides you with a web interface for collecting, organizing and sharing bookmarks to the sites on the web that are precious to you. You can browse and filter your bookmarks via tags, folders and by using the built-in search feature and you can share folders with users and groups and using public links. Furthermore, in order to access your bookmarks anywhere, it also allows you to synchronize third-party clients via a built-in REST API.

This documentation describes how to use this API.
