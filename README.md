> Bookmarks app for Nextcloud

This app provides you with a web interface for collecting and organizing bookmarks to the places on the web that are precious to you. You can browse and filter your bookmarks via tags and folders and by using the built-in search feature. Furthermore, in order to access your bookmarks anywhere, it also allows you to synchronize third-party clients via a built-in REST API -- in your browsers and on your phone.
