Developer setup info:
---------------------
### Installation:
Install it from the app store in Nextcloud itself or just clone this repo into your apps directory on your server.


Status :
---------
Rewrite by [Stefan Klemm] aka ganomi (https://github.com/ganomi)

* This is a refactored / rewritten version of the bookmarks app using the app framework
* Dependency Injection for user and db is used througout the controllers
* The Routing features a consistent rest api
* The Routing provides some legacy routes, so that for exampe the Android Bookmarks App still works.
* Merged all the changes from https://github.com/nextcloud/bookmarks/pull/68 and added visual fixes. App uses the App Framework Styling on the Client side now.

There is a publicly available api that provides access to bookmarks per user. (This is usefull in connection with the Wordpress Plugin https://github.com/mario-nolte/oc2wp-bookmarks)

REST API
---------
In order to access the REST API you will need to provide credentials for the user on behalf of which you'd
like to access the bookmarks app. This can be done using Basic Auth and must happen for every request.
