> Bookmarks app for Nextcloud

This app provides you with a web interface for collecting and organizing bookmarks to the sites on the web that are precious to you. You can browse and filter your bookmarks via the tags you give them and by using the built-in search feature. Furthermore, in order to be able to access your bookmarks anywhere, it also allows you to synchronize third-party clients via a built-in REST API.

## Background
The bookmarks app is quite old and has gone through many hands. It is now more relevant than ever, as the nextcloud app providing support for Firefox Sync doesn't work with the latest versions of Firefox anymore. Currently, there are efforts to make it live up to the expectations produced by the gap that was left by the firefox sync app.

## Install

Install this app in the app store of your nextcloud instance (you must have administrator privileges). You will find it in the 'Organization' category.
