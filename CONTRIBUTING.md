### Short version

 * The [**issue template can be found here**][template]. Please always use the issue template when reporting issues.

### Guidelines
* Please search the existing issues first, it's likely that your issue was already reported or even fixed.
  - Go to one of the repositories, click "issues" and type any word in the top search/command bar.
  - You can also filter by appending e. g. "state:open" to the search string.
  - More info on [search syntax within github](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues)
* This repository ([bookmarks](https://github.com/nextcloud/bookmarks/issues)) is *only* for issues within the bookmarks code.
* __SECURITY__: Report any potential security bug to security@nextcloud.com following our [security policy](https://nextcloud.com/security/) instead of filing an issue in our bug tracker
* Report the issue using our [template][template], it includes all the information we need to track down the issue.

Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues.
